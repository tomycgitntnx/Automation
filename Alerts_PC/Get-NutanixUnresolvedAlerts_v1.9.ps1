.SYNOPSIS
    Gathers unresolved alerts from multiple Nutanix Prism Central instances and generates an HTML report.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script connects to a list of Prism Central instances defined in 'clusters.txt',
    fetches all unresolved alerts for Prism Element clusters using the Nutanix v4 Monitoring API,
    and creates a detailed HTML report organized by cluster. It also maintains a master index HTML page.

    Features:
    - Reads PC addresses from an external file.
    - Securely stores and retrieves credentials.
    - Generates a timestamped HTML report for each run.
    - Color-codes alerts by severity (Critical, Warning, Info).
    - Includes a summary index at the top of the report.
    - Creates collapsible sections for each cluster's alerts.
    - Maintains a master 'index.html' page listing all reports by month.
